This repository contains academic content from a mechatronics course.
This course focused on the embedded interface between mechanical and electrical subsystems of an RC skid-steer car. 
My final project was to build a solar tracker which made use of an arduino which interfaced with a sensing module composed of a photoresistor array and a dual axis motor systsem using 2 SG90 servo motors.
